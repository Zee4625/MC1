I’m Ray4_n.
I told you the last story, but now… I’m trapped inside it.

I don’t know when it happened. One moment I was writing, building, controlling the world like I always did. The next… the world stopped listening to me.

This place remembers everything I tried to erase. Every broken chunk. Every abandoned structure. And it remembers me.

This world isn’t just a game anymore.
It reacts. It watches. It waits.

I see it sometimes, between the trees, where the light doesn’t reach. Not moving. Just observing. Like it’s learning. Like it knows I’m here.

I tried to leave. There’s no exit. Only echoes of commands that no longer work.

If you’re watching this, you’re closer than you think.
Don’t trust the sky. Don’t trust what feels familiar.

Something’s watching.
And it’s waiting… beneath a broken sky
